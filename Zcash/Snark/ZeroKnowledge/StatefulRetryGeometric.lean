# Geometric comparison with a retained state

The simulator supplies the continuation probability in this hybrid. Its retry
bound is uniform in the retained state; the real process need not have
independent retry decisions, or even terminate almost surely. A state-dependent
potential pays the next comparison and the retry-weighted future comparisons.
