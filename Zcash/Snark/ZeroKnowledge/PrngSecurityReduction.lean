# From a PRNG game to a tested simulation experiment

The auxiliary data may select the public coins, deterministic continuation, and
view test, but is independent of the fresh seed. The reduction receives one
whole candidate tape, runs that continuation with independent public coins,
and applies the view test. Exact equality of the distinguishing experiments
lets its PRNG advantage add once to the protocol's statistical error.

Membership of this entire reduction in the stated admissible class remains an
explicit premise. This module supplies the distribution reduction, not a
running-time proof for arbitrary supplied continuations or tests.
