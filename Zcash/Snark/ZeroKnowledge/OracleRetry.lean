# Observed retry decisions and the retained oracle state

Only an ordinary attempt with status `failed retryRandomness` continues.
Completion, the coincident-opening error, and simulator programming failure all
stop. An observation always returns the cache to be used by any continuation;
programming failure returns the unchanged prior cache.
