# Simulation with an exceptional observation map

The real observation may differ from the simulated observation on an exceptional
set of projected views. One event comparison suffices: the final error is the
existing simulation error plus the simulator's exceptional-set probability.
This avoids charging the same distribution replacement a second time merely
to move an exceptional-event bound from the simulator to the prover.
