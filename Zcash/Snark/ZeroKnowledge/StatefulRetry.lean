# Finite retained retries carrying state between attempts

Each attempt receives the state returned by its predecessor. Only the supplied
retry predicate permits another attempt; terminal outcomes stop immediately.
The output keeps the entire observed history, explicit exhaustion, and the final
state. This model does not replace a retained oracle cache by fresh verifier coins.
