# The complete observable stream of stateful retries

Each present entry retains the attempted result and the resulting public state.
After a terminal attempt every subsequent entry is absent. An execution that
never stops retains its entire infinite stream. The implementation performs the
same retry decision as the finite runner, without a termination assumption.
