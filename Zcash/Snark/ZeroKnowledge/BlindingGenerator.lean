# The blinding-generator condition in a prime-order group

Scalar multiplication by a nonzero point is injective in every field module.
When the group and scalar field have the same finite cardinality, it is also
surjective. This supplies the bijection used by the statistical simulation from
the concrete group order and a nonidentity check on the blinding generator.
