# Finite simulation with state-dependent attempt laws

An attempt's error may depend on a bound on retained state size. Each retry can
increase that bound by a known amount. The proof compares continuations under
the real attempt law, so only its supported state-growth property is needed;
the simulator retains the same full history and final state.
