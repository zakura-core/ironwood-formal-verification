# Continuous private generation with separately supplied verifier coins

Each started attempt receives its public reply slots and one full private block.
Reply slots never come from the private generator. The private state stops at the
last started attempt; the public observation nevertheless agrees with replay
from a preallocated private prefix covering the entire attempt budget.
