# Independent retries with every attempt retained

Unlike `boundedRetries`, this experiment keeps the earlier failed observations.
Only membership in the supplied retry set requests another attempt; every other
outcome is terminal. An exhausted budget is represented explicitly. Each new
attempt uses the same law independently of the complete preceding history.
