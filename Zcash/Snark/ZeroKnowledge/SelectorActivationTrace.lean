# Compositional selector-activation traces

These projections discard witness computations and keep every selector activation,
its local row, and its region's position in the synthesis stream. Empty regions
remain in the trace because they still advance the floor planner's region index.
`activations_eq_placeSelectorTrace` connects this smaller representation to the
compiler's actual activation walk, for any supplied placement.
