# Check that every deliverable soundness endpoint is named in a census pin.
#
# `assert_axioms` / `assert_computable` (and Mathlib's `assert_no_sorry`) are built on
# `Lean.collectAxioms`, which traverses a declaration's transitive *dependencies*. An endpoint
# that nothing pinned depends on is therefore invisible to every census entry: a `sorry` or a
# stray `native_decide` in its own proof reaches no assertion, and the build stays green. That
# is the "trusted-base escape the census fails to catch" failure mode, and it applies exactly to
# the top-level leaves — which is what the advertised capstones are.
#
# The rule this script enforces: a declaration whose base name matches one of the endpoint
# naming patterns below must be named directly in an `assert_axioms` or `assert_computable`
# entry in one of the census files. Direct, not transitive: an endpoint states the trust tier of
# its own conclusion, and coverage that happens to flow through some other pin disappears
# silently the moment that dependent is refactored.
#
# `assert_no_sorry` does NOT satisfy the rule. It bounds only sorries, while the census claim is
# a bound on the whole trusted base; an endpoint carrying only `assert_no_sorry` can still reach
# an unexpected axiom. Endpoints may carry both.
#
# Names are compared fully qualified. The enclosing namespace is reconstructed from the
# `namespace`/`end` pairs above the declaration, which is what the census entries must also
# write (`Zcash.Meta.AxiomCheck.checkFullyQualified`).
#
# Scope: this guards against accidental omissions, NOT adversarial code. A declaration whose
# name does not match a pattern is not an endpoint as far as this check is concerned. New endpoint
# families must either extend the protocol-family alternatives below or carry one of the semantic
# markers `_error_bound`, `_finite_security`, `_prob_le`, or `_capstone` — in any position, so a
# qualifier such as `_of_<premise>` or `_at_<instance>` may follow it. The declaration's name must
# be on the same line as its declaration keyword. Run from the repository root; exits non-zero on
# violation.
#
# The same rule is enforced a second time from the elaborated environment:
# `Zcash/Meta/EndpointCensus.lean` ports the pattern below to a Lean predicate, the census
# commands record every pin they elaborate, and `Zcash/CensusCheck.lean` (the `CensusCheck`
# default target) asserts that no endpoint in the census files' import closure is unpinned. That
# closes what this line parser cannot see — declarations emitted by custom commands, unrecognized
# modifiers, or multiline syntax — while this scan keeps the whole file tree in scope, census
# imports or not. Keep `ENDPOINT_RE` and `Zcash.Meta.isEndpointBaseName` in sync.

# A declaration is a deliverable endpoint when its base name matches this pattern. The leading
# alternatives retain the established endpoint families: the verifier-soundness rungs
# (`orchard_verifier_*`), the composed Action probability endpoints (`orchard_action_*`), the
# captured knowledge-error endpoints (`orchard_deployed_*`), the concrete-statement terminals
# (`*bundleStatement_or_relation*`), and the profiled work-factor packages (`*workFactor*`). The
# final alternative is deliberately protocol-independent: the standardized semantic markers keep a
# new capstone family inside the census without requiring another prefix to be added here.
# `_measure_le` and `_probability_bound` are the two older spellings for a probability bound, kept
# matching so a capstone that still carries either is demanded rather than silently unpinned; they
# also match surface, root-set, and per-challenge measures inside the AGM, Action, and pricing
# layers, which are pinned for that reason rather than as independent claims. `_capstone` is the
# explicit marker for endpoints that are neither an error formula nor a concrete finite-security
# statement.
#
# The Rust-to-Lean boundary contributes three more families, all leaves in the same sense: the
# per-family statements of record (`nonInteractiveFingerprint_matches_derived*`), the quantified
# match's generic and per-capture epsilon bounds (`competing_*`, covering both
# `competing_coefficient_family_agreement_le*` in `Zcash.Snark` and the
# `competing_family_agreement_le*` headliners beside each random fixture), and the `Perm`→positional
# bridges (`fingerprint_matches_positional`) that join the two.
#
# `orchard_verifier_*` and `*workFactor*` both currently match nothing and are retained as guards,
# so a reintroduced name in either family is demanded rather than silently unpinned. The
# `orchard_verifier_*` rungs were retired with the legacy rewind paths; `*workFactor*` named the
# Action knowledge capstone's `2^123` instantiation, the consensus-maximum packages, and the
# deployment-record transport, until all three were renamed onto the
# `orchard_deployed_*`/`orchard_action_*` prefixes and the `_finite_security` suffix, which is
# what matches them now.
#
# `_prob_le` is the current spelling for a probability bound, alongside the two older ones; it is
# matched for the same reason they are.
#
# A semantic marker matches in any position, provided what follows it is the end of the name or a
# non-alphanumeric character (`_` or `'`): `attack_prob_le`, `attack_prob_le'`,
# `bound_measure_le_for`, and `attack_prob_le_of_textbookDL` all carry a marker;
# `attack_prob_lemma` does not. The marker used to be anchored at the end of the name, and that
# anchor lost endpoints twice. A `_measure_le` endpoint disappeared from this check the moment it
# was generalized over `numProofs` and gained a `_for` suffix, so `_for` was admitted (and later
# `_experiment` and `_idealizedks`, the experiment-placement and idealization qualifiers, in the
# same way). The anchor then deliberately kept the `_prob_le_of_<premise>` spellings out, on the
# reasoning that a bound conditional on a named premise is consumed by some unconditional
# capstone and is never itself a leaf — which is false: the straight-line AGM binding and
# deployed-root capstones are stated exactly in that form, as a probability bound *of*
# textbook-DL hardness, nothing consumes them, and no census entry disclosed their
# `native_decide` base until they were pinned. Generalizing, instantiating, or conditioning an
# endpoint must never retire its census obligation: a name that carries a marker states a
# probability, error, or security claim, and its pin states that claim's trusted base whatever
# qualifier follows.
